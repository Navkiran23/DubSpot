## Communication Channels
### Slack
We will primarily be using Slack to communicate with each other regarding the project.
This is for quick updates and correspondence, as well as planning Zoom meetings.
### Zoom
We will also use Zoom for online meetings. We will all agree on a time to meet online, 
where we will update each other on progress and issues. We can also do demos on progress and code together.
