    <p1>Welcome to DubSpot</p1>
    <p>DubSpot is a revolutionary schedule builder application that enables students to discover courses and 
      develop their own schedules quickly and easily. Through DubSpot, students will be able to contribute to 
      course rankings to give insightful information for students looking to design their schedules. Likewise, 
      the primary purpose for DubSpot is to create seamless schedules. Students can sync their course requirements 
      and gather a recommended course load. Furthermore, students can also choose specific courses they want to 
      enroll in and then have filtered results for other courses that will not conflict with current time slots. 
      All in all, DupSpot aims to solve the issue of stressful registration periods by providing a streamline course 
      schedule and backup plans if their first choices are not fulfilled.
